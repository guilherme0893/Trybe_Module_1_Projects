Hello!

This repository presents all main projects developed by me during the Module 1 at Trybe.

Here the major language used is JavaScript

The projects here are: 

1- Color Guess - a simple game to guess the color shown in screen -- under construction

2- Unit Test - this project is focused on tests and the use of Jest

3- Meme Generator - a project that generates memes -- under construction

4- Mistery Letter - wanna create a spooky letter? here is the place

5- Pixel Art - this one is really cool. here you can create your own artwork by coloring boxes

6- PlayGround Functions - this is a good repository of training logic and the usage of JavaScript

7- Shopping Cart - wanna buy something? in this project you can simulate it, browsing in products available in a Mercado Livre API

8- Tod List - do you often forget what you should do? In this project you can create a to do list, and never lose an appointment ever again!

Major details are found in their respective folders. In the future I expect to reproduce them based on React.

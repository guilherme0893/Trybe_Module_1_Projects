# SKILLS AND GOALS

  In this project, the main goals were to:

- (1) CSS manipulation

- (2) Javascript manipulation


## WHAT WAS DEVELOPED

- Here I created a To do list, in order to help remebering daily activities. Basically, one can add an activity by typing it in the box and pressing the blue button (creat task). All taks are numbered when added. To confirm that any activity was done/over, it is possible to double click it and cross it from the list. In order to remove the finished task, it is necessary to press the removed finished button (remmover finalizados) -- it can also be used to remove multiple tasks. The application also have the remove selected button(remover selecionados), the up and down buttons to swipe through the tasks, and the save tasks (salvar tarefas) where the tasks are saved into the local storage.

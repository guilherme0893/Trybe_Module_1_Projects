## SKILLS AND GOALS

In this project the goals were the following:

- (1) Perform requisitions from API *(Application Programming Interface)* from Mercado Livre;
- (2) Apply JavaScript, CSS and HTML;
- (3) Work with async functions;
- (4) Unit tests for the application using Jest.

## WHAT WAS DEVELOPED

  Here the goal was to create a shopping cart based on API data. The work was performed based on different requisitions from the API -- here I was focused in the requisition of computer data. It is important to highlight that different functions were already implemented from the begining. The shopping cart is able to get all the products when they are clicked, and the total value is shown. Also, it is possible to reload the page and not lose the products, and they are saved into the local storage.
